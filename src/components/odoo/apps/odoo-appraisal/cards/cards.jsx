            Build your own surveys to collect important information and/or opinions from your assets. Rapidly add questions, edit pages and draft a useful survey, with the help of excellent built-in templates or create your own design from scratch. Convert current surveys into templates to use and change them later. Proofread your surveys before uploading them: get the manager's review or other employees' and allow them to include comments before completing the final draft of surveys. You can also even draft multiple surveys for each step of evaluation to send them to different people.
